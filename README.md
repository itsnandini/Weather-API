# Weather-API
This is a geolocation-based weather app that will show us the current weather data depending on the user's location.

##### By building this app, I learned some stuff like:*
- Interacting with the DOM
- The use of Fetch API
- The navigator object of JavaScript
- How to use a third-party API service and more

##### The HTML of the app is straightforward.
You can see the image below of the final output to get an idea about our markup style.

We have an image that will change according to the weather. The location will be based on the user's geolocation. Below it is the summary of the weather, the temperature is in both Celcius and Fahrenheit. And in the end, we are showing the sunrise and sunset time.
