# Weather-API
This is a geolocation-based weather app that will show us the current weather data depending on the user's location.

*By building this app, I learned some stuff like:*
- Interacting with the DOM
- The use of Fetch API
- The navigator object of JavaScript
- How to use a third-party API service and more
